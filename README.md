Lecture: Gaussian Process Modelling in Python
---

This folder contains material for the JEDI Madagascar Workshop. 

There are two iPython scripts to accompany the lecture:

 - GPMIntro.ipynb
 - GPMCarbonDioxide.ipynb
 
 These scripts use the input data set:
 
 - mauna_loa.dat
 
 You can also find the contents of these scripts described step-by-step here:

Tutorial: Gaussian Process Modelling in Python
---

This folder contains material for the JEDI Madagascar workshop project on Gaussian Process Modelling. There are two levels of tutorial depending on Python proficiency. Both use the dataset KIC1430163.tbl.

Level: Beginner
- KeplerLightCurve.ipynb - uses the **george** (v0.2.1) GPM library

A step by step guide can also be found here: https://allofyourbases.com/2017/09/23/spinning-stars/

Level: Intermediate
- KeplerLightCurveCelerite.ipynb - uses the **celerite** GPM library; includes MCMC optimization of hyper-parameters

A step by step guide can also be found here: https://allofyourbases.com/2017/10/02/spinning-stars-ii-celerite/
